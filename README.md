## About


hyperDrive is a site we designed, built, and deployed to help users overcome planning obstacles when seeking to achieve a goal. After answering four simple prompts (role, goal, start date, and end date), hyperDrive will provide a customized action plan, within the user's timeline, to help the user accomplish their goal.  


Deployed Site:  https://journeypath-17d60.web.app/ 

Please note:  Commented-out code has been left in our resository as this is a ongoing project.
